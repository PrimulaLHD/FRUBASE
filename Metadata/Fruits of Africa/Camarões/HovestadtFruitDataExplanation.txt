Hovestadt data set (status ca. 1998)
Explanations
Column 
1	species name (following Hutchingson & Dalziel 1954-1972, which is not necessarily the most advanced naming)
2+3	family and an abreviation used for the species name

4-7	basic plant traits
4	principal growth form (list contains only woody plant species)
5	principal habitat of occurence (gal. = gallery forests along rivers, for. = (dry) forests not associated with rivers usually forest islands)
6	indicates whether species sheds leafs during the dry season (ca. October-March)
7	principal mode of seed dispersal. In practice, there is a considerable overlap in the use of fruits by birds and mammals.

8-11	fruiting season and production
8	season of fruiting
9	approximate month when fruitng begins
10	duration of fruting season (across species, individual trees usually much shorter)

12-22	fruit traits
12	type (mostly separating between fleshy fruits (usually consumed by animals) and dry fruits
13	color of ripe fruit
14	principal form of ripe fruit
15	structure of fruit surface
16	distinction between thin or thick (hard) fruit skin/shell
17	states whether seeds can be easily separated from fruit flesh (lose) or not; only relevnt for animal dispersed species
18	average weight of fruits in [g]
19+20	dimension of fruits in mm - shortest and longest dimension were taken
21	average number of seeds/fruit - numbers beyond 50 are only rough estimates. Verbal statements are based on casual inspection only
22	number of fruits from which measurements were taken (not more than 2 from an individul tree)

23-30	seed traits
23	classification of seed type (assumed to be constant within genus). Information taken from Hladik & Miquel (1990)
24	(for wind dispersed species only) type of dispersal supporting structure
25	form
26	structure of seed surface
27-29	weight [mg] and physical dimensions [mm] of seeds
30	number of seeds measured. Letters refer to data taken from literature: L: Lieberman et al. 1987, M: Maydell 1986, R: Refisch 1995 (a master thesis prepared in our institute)

31-34	basic data on seed dispersal by four different important frugivorouse species in the Comoé NP
	Pycnonotus barbatus (Common Garden Bulbul) is one of the most abundant bird species in (West) Africa and numerically the most important
	fruit consuming species (38.5% of 17600 sightings of fruit eating species) in the Comoé NP (the species is rather omnivour). Species is slightly smaller than a thrush (<40g)
	
	Bycanistes spec. includes 3 species of larger hornbills (500-1300 g): B. fistulator, B. cylindricus and B. subcylindricus. These hornbills are all
	strongly frugivore and apparently have very large home ranges they search in small troops (<20)

	Papio cynocephalus (baboon). Species in general omnivore but regulary includes fruit and seeds in its diet.

	Loxodonath africana (elephant) is probably the only legitimate seeds disperser for some of the plant species with very large seeds. Species is
	now presumably extinct in the study area.
