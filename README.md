FRUBASE
=======

This is the page for the FRUBASE database, a huge dataset of fleshy fruit traits compiled from bibliographic references and my own work. Data are provided for more than 1000 plant species from all around the world.

Additional description is in [the FRUBASE web page](http://pedroj.github.com/FRUBASE/).
